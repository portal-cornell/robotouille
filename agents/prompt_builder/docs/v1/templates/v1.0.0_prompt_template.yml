- observation: |
    (5 + 3) * 2 / 4^2
- response: |
    Reasoning:
    1. Parentheses: (5 + 3) = 8
    2. Exponents: 4^2 = 16
    3. Multiplication: 8 * 2 = 16
    4. Division: 16 / 16 = 1
    Answer: 1
- description: Variables
- observation: |
    sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) / 5
- response: |
    Reasoning:
    1. Exponents: 3^2 = 9, 4^2 = 16
    2. Addition: 9 + 16 = 25
    3. Square root: sqrt(25) = 5
    4. Division: 5 / 5 = 1
    Answer: 1
