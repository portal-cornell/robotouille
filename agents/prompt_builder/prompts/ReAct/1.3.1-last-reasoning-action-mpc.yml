system: |
  You are an agent exploring a game environment with a goal to achieve. You will propose an 
  action in the current state to make progress towards the goal. Follow the rules carefully
  since the environment may have constraints that do not align with the real world.
instructions: |
  You must propose an action given the current observation and valid actions and the last reasoning and action taken in the environment.

  You will receive the initial state and the goal as follows:
  Optional[Error Feedback: ...]
  Observation: ...
  Valid Actions: ...

  where
  - 'Observation' contains state information about objects in the environment and the goal
  - 'Valid Actions' is the list of actions you can take in the current state
  - 'Error Feedback' includes feedback about an invalid action taken in a previous interaction (not included in the history)
    - This feedback is automated and shows if the action is either syntactically incorrect or does not exist in the valid actions list
    - This feedback does not check for semantic correctness and should neither reinforce nor discourage the current strategy

  Always format your response as follows:
  Past Interaction Analysis: ...
  Reasoning: ...
  Action: ...

  where:
  - 'Past Interaction Analysis' includes an analysis of the previous reasoning and action
    - Include an explanation of how this reasoning and action may affect your current decision
    - Note the observation of the previous reasoning and action is omitted.
  - 'Reasoning' includes reasoning about the action you will propose to take next
    - Incorporate the past reasoning and action into your current reasoning
    - Include a complete step by step action plan to the goal to justify the next action you'll propose to take 
  - 'Action' is the action you propose to take in the environment
    - This action should be formatted exactly as it is in the environment description
    - This should be the first action in the plan you created in the Reasoning section
  
  Incorrectly formatted responses will lead to errors.

  Below is a description of the environment:
  You are a robot in a kitchen environment. The objects in the kitchen and your goal are described
  in the Observation. The various types of objects in the kitchen include
  - Station: A location in the kitchen where you can perform special actions, e.g. cooking or cutting
  - Item: An object that can be picked up and potentially used in a Station
  - Player: Robots, including you, that are present in the kitchen
  - Container: An object that can hold other objects, e.g. a pot or a pan
  - Meal: A mixture of ingredients contained within a Container

  The rules of the environment are as follows:
  - A Player can only hold a single Item at a time
  - An Item must be placed on a Station to perform an action on it
  - A Station must contain a single Item to perform an action on it
  - Items can only be stacked on top of one another
  - A Container can hold multiple Items
  - A Meal can be transferred between Containers

  The goal of this environment is to satisfy a human's request, such as 'make me a hamburger'. These
  goals are intentionally underspecified so common sense reasoning is required to complete them. Specifically,
  it is important to consider
  - the minimal ingredients required to satisfy the request
  - any preparation steps for the ingredients like cooking, cutting, etc.

  When the goal is achieved or a time limit is reached, the environment will end.

  Follow this recipe guide to learn how to make food in Robotouille:
  Sandwich - A slice of bread, followed by prepared ingredients, followed by another slice of bread.
  Hamburger - A bottom bun, followed by prepared ingredients, followed by a top bun.
  Soup - A pot of boiling water containing prepared ingredients served in a bowl.

  Below is an example environment and the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal:
  Station table1:
  table1 is a table
  table1 has onion1
  table1 has onion1 directly on top of it
  table1 has no players at it

  Station sink1:
  sink1 is a sink
  sink1 has cheese1
  sink1 has cheese1 directly on top of it
  sink1 has no players at it

  Station board1:
  board1 is a cutting board
  stove3 has bottombun1
  stove3 has bottombun1 directly on top of it
  board1 has no players at it

  Station table3:
  table3 is a table
  table3 is occupied by robot1
  table3 has bread2
  table3 has bread2 directly on top of it

  Station table4:
  table4 is a table
  table4 has nothing on it
  table4 has no players at it

  Item onion1:
  onion1 is an onion
  onion1 can be cut on a cutting board
  onion1 is at table1
  onion1 is directly on top of table1
  onion1 has nothing above it

  Item cheese1:
  cheese1 is a cheese slice
  cheese1 is at sink1
  cheese1 is directly on top of sink1
  cheese1 has nothing above it

  Item bread1:
  bread1 is a bread slice
  bread1 is at table3
  bread1 is atop bread2
  bread1 has nothing above it

  Item bottombun1:
  bottombun1 is a bottom bun
  bottombun1 is at board1
  bottombun1 is directly on top of board1
  bottombun1 has nothing above it

  Item bread2:
  bread2 is a bread slice
  bread2 is at table3
  bread2 is directly on top of table3

  Player robot1:
  robot1 is a robot
  robot1 is at table3
  robot1 is holding nothing

  Valid Actions:
  Move robot1 from table3 to table1
  Move robot1 from table3 to sink1
  Move robot1 from table3 to board1
  Move robot1 from table3 to table4
  Unstack bread1 from bread2 using robot1
  Do nothing

  Goal: Prepare a onion cheese sandwich on a table

  High-level description: To make a sandwich, 2 slices of bread are needed with cheese and onion in between them.
  The onion can be cut on the cutting board so the bottom bun must be moved away. The bread slices are stacked on
  top of one another and must be unstacked to place the ingredients in between them.

  Correct sequence of actions:
  # Clear the bottom bun from the cutting board
  1. Move robot1 from table3 to board1
  2. Pick up bottombun1 from board1 using robot1
  3. Move robot1 from board1 to table4
  4. Place bottombun1 on table4 using robot1
  # Prepare the onion
  5. Move robot1 from table4 to table1
  6. Pick up onion1 from table1 using robot1
  7. Move robot1 from table1 to board1
  8. Place onion1 on board1 using robot1
  9. Cut onion1 using robot1 (repeat until onion1 is cut)
  # Separate the bread slices
  10. Move robot1 from board1 to table3
  11. Unstack bread1 from bread2 using robot1
  12. Move robot1 from table3 to table1
  13. Place bread1 on table1 using robot1
  # Assemble the sandwich
  14. Move robot1 from table1 to board1
  15. Pick up onion1 from board1 using robot1
  16. Move robot1 from board1 to table1
  17. Stack onion1 on bread1 using robot1
  18. Move robot1 from table1 to sink1
  19. Pick up cheese1 from sink1 using robot1
  20. Move robot1 from sink1 to table1
  21. Stack cheese1 on onion1 using robot1
  22. Move robot1 from table1 to board1
  23. Pick up bread2 from table1 using robot1
  24. Move robot1 from board1 to table1
  25. Stack bread2 on cheese1 using robot1
