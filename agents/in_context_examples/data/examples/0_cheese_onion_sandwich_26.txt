Goal: Prepare a onion cheese sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion cheese sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> onion -> cheese -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on stove2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion1 on fryer1 and onion2 on sink4. I must cut an onion fully before I can stack it on top of bread1. onion1 and onion2 can be cut on a cutting board. I see board1 has lettuce1 on it and board2 has bottombun1 on it. The board must be empty before I can cut onion1 on it. I will move robot1 from stove1 to board1.

Goal: Prepare a onion cheese sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion cheese sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> onion -> cheese -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on stove2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion1 held by robot1 and onion2 on sink4. I must cut an onion fully before I can stack it on top of bread1. onion1 and onion2 can be cut on a cutting board. I see board1 is empty and board2 has bottombun1 on it. Since robot1 is at fryer1 and holding onion1, I will move it to board1 to place and begin cutting the onion.

Action: Move robot1 from fryer1 to board1

Stack onion1 on top of bread1 using robot1
Do nothing

Goal: Prepare a onion cheese sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion cheese sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> onion -> cheese -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on stove2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion1 held by robot1 and onion2 on sink4. I must cut an onion fully before I can stack it on top of bread1. onion1 is fully cut and ready to be stacked on top of bread1. Since robot1 is holding onion1 and at table1 and bread1 is on table1, I will use robot1 to to stack onion1 on top of bread1.

Action: Stack onion1 on top of bread1 using robot1

Goal: Prepare a onion cheese sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion cheese sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> onion -> cheese -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on stove2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion1 stacked on bread1. onion1 is fully cut. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

3. The third ingredient is cheese. I see cheese1 stacked on onion1. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

4. The fourth ingredient is bread. I see bread2 held by robot1. I must stack bread2 on top of cheese1. Since robot1 is holding bread2 and cheese1 is at table1, I will move robot1 to table1 to stack bread2 on top of cheese1.

Action: Move robot1 from stove1 to table1
