Goal: Prepare a cheese sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make a cheese sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> cheese -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table2 and bread2 on table3. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is cheese. I see cheese1 on sink1. I must stack cheese1 on top of bread1. I will move robot1 to sink1 to pick up cheese1.

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table2 and bread2 on table3. Since bread1 is on top of a table and has cheese1 on top of it, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is cheese. cheese1 is stacked on top of bread1. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

3. The third ingredient is bread. robot1 is holding bread2. I must stack bread2 on top of cheese1. Since robot1 is at table2 where cheese1, I will make it stack bread2 on top of cheese1.

Action: Stack bread2 on top of cheese1 using robot1
