Goal: Prepare a lettuce sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make a lettuce sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> lettuce -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on table2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is lettuce. I see lettuce1 on fryer1. lettuce1 can be cut on a cutting board. I must cut lettuce1 fully before I can stack it on top of bread1. I will move robot1 to fryer1 to pick up lettuce1.

Goal: Prepare a lettuce sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make a lettuce sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> lettuce -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on table2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is lettuce. robot1 is holding lettuce1. lettuce1 has been cut. I must stack lettuce on top of bread1. Since robot1 is at board2, I will move it to table1 to stack lettuce1 on top of bread1.

Action: Move robot1 from board2 to table1
