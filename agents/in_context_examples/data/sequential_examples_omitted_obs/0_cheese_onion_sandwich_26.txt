Goal: Prepare a onion cheese sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion cheese sandwich on a table. I need ingredients stacked from bottom to top: table -> bread -> onion -> cheese -> bread

1. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on stove2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

2. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion1 on fryer1 and onion2 on sink4. I must cut an onion fully before I can stack it on top of bread1. onion1 and onion2 can be cut on a cutting board. I see board1 has lettuce1 on it and board2 has bottombun1 on it. The board must be empty before I can cut onion1 on it. I will move robot1 from stove1 to board1.

Action: Move robot1 from stove1 to board1

I see board1 is empty and board2 has bottombun1 on it. Since board1 is empty, I will use it to cut onion1. Since robot1 is holding lettuce1 after clearing board1, I must move the lettuce to another location. table3 is empty, so I will move robot1 from board1 to table3 to place lettuce1 on it.

Action: Move robot1 from board1 to table3

Since robot1 is holding lettuce1 and can only hold one item at a time, I will place lettuce1 on table3 because it is empty and we are using neither table3 nor lettuce1 for the sandwich.

Action: Place lettuce1 on table3 using robot1
