Goal: Prepare an onion chicken sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion chicken sandwich on a table. I can cook chicken while doing other tasks. Thus, I
will stack the ingredients from bottom to top as follows: table -> bread -> onion -> chicken -> bread.

1. First I will leave the chicken cooking. chicken1 has already been cooked and is at stove1. Thus, I will leave it in place until I am ready to stack it on the sandwich.

2. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on fryer2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

3. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion1 on sink3 and am holding onion2. I must cut an onion fully before I can stack it on top of bread1. onion2 can be cut on a cutting board. I see board1 has lettuce1 on it and board2 has nothing on it. Since I am at board2, I will place onion2 on it to cut it.

Action: Place onion2 on board2 using robot1

Goal: Prepare an onion chicken sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion chicken sandwich on a table. I can cook chicken while doing other tasks. Thus, I
will stack the ingredients from bottom to top as follows: table -> bread -> onion -> chicken -> bread.

1. First I will leave the chicken cooking. chicken1 has already been cooked and is at stove1. Thus, I will leave it in place until I am ready to stack it on the sandwich.

2. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on fryer2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

3. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion2 stacked on bread1. Since onion2 is already stacked on bread1, I will leave it in place and move to the next step.

4. The third ingredient is chicken. I see chicken1 cooked and at stove1. I will move to stove1 to pick up chicken1 and then stack it on top of onion2.

Action: Move robot1 from table1 to stove1

Goal: Prepare an onion chicken sandwich on a table


Reasoning: The goal is to make an onion chicken sandwich on a table. I can cook chicken while doing other tasks. Thus, I
will stack the ingredients from bottom to top as follows: table -> bread -> onion -> chicken -> bread.

1. First I will leave the chicken cooking. chicken1 is already cooked and in the sandwich.

2. The first ingredient is bread. I see bread1 on table1 and bread2 on fryer2. Since bread1 is on top of a table, it will serve as the base of the sandwich. I will leave it in place since it is already in the correct position.

3. The second ingredient is onion. I see onion2 stacked on bread1. Since onion2 is already stacked on bread1, I will leave it in place and move to the next step.

4. The third ingredient is chicken. I see chicken1 stacked on onion2. Since chicken1 is already stacked on onion2, I will leave it in place and move to the next step.

5. The fourth ingredient is bread. I am holding bread2 and must stack bread2 on chicken1. Since I am at fryer2, I will move from fryer2 to table1 to stack bread2 on top of chicken1 to complete the sandwich.

Action: Move robot1 from fryer2 to table1
