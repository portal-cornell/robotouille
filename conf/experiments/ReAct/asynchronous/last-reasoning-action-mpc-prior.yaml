    It is *important* to follow these rules before proposing an action:
    - A Player can pick up a single Item at a time
      - This means that you should not attempt to pick up an Item if you are already holding one
    - An Item must be placed on a Station to perform an action on it
      - This means that you cannot perform an action on an Item while holding it or if it is stacked on another Item at a Station
      - This also means that you must perform an action on an Item at a Station for state changes to occur (e.g. cooking)
    - A Station must contain a single Item to perform an action on it
      - This means that you can only bring an Item to a Station if it is already empty
    - Items can be stacked on top of one another
      - This means that Items are stacked on top of Items
    
    
    In addition, do not blindly follow these rules; think about how your actions will affect future actions since your plan may
    require you to break rules in the future to achieve the goal.
