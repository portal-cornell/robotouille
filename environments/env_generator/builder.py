def create_unique_and_combination_preds(environment_dict):
    """
    Creates lists of unique and combination predicates from an environment dictionary.

    This function is used for goal creation. A goal in PDDL is a conjunction or disjunction
    of predicates. The goal JSON is specified by a predicate name, the arguments it takes,
    and then an ID for each argument. The ID can be used to specify a specific entity of a particular
    type (a digit ID) or a unique entity (a non-digit ID).

    Unique predicates are those whose arguments only refer to unique entities. This means that
    the arguments IDs are only non-digits and therefore there is a 1 to 1 mapping between that
    predicate and the entities within the environment_dict. For example, perhaps the goal is
    to hold a specific item or to have a specific item on a specific station. This would be
    a unique predicate.

    Combination predicates are those that contain at least one argument that refers to a specific entity
    of a particular type. This means that at least one argument's ID is a digit. This means that
    any entity of that type can be included in the goal and thus a disjunction must be used to
    include all possible entities. For example, perhaps the goal is to hold any patty or to create a
    lettuce burger where the ingredients can be any found in the environment. This would be a combination
    predicate.

    To create all the possible combinations of combination predicates, a dictionary is used to
    store all the specific entities of a particular type. The dictionary is keyed by the entity type
    and the value is a mapping from the argument's ID to a list of all the entities of that type. The
    dictionary isn't a direct mapping from argument ID to entities to account for cases such as making
    double cheese burgers where the same entity can be used twice.

    TODO: Allow for combination predicates that aren't specific entities of a particular type but
          any entities of a particular type (wild cards) For example, make a burger and place on
