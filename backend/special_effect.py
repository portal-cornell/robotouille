    This class represents special effects in Robotouille.

    Some effects are not easily represented by immediate effects. For example,
    some effects may need repeated actions to be performed, or may only kick in
    after a certain amount of time has passed, or may create new predicates or 
    objects not already present in the state. These effects are represented by
    this class.

    The SpecialEffect class should not be directly instantiated, but rather 
    should be inherited by one of its subclasses.
