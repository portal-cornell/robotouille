        About Robotouille
      </h2>
      <p className="text-white text-left">
        Robots will be involved in every part of our lives in the near future so
        we need to teach them how to perform complex tasks. Humans break apart
        complex tasks like making hamburgers into smaller subtasks like cutting
        lettuce and cooking patties. We can teach robots to do the same by
        showing them how to perform easier tasks subtasks and then combine those
        subtasks to perform harder tasks. We created Robotouille so we can
        stress test this idea through an easily customizable cooking environment
        where the task possibilities are endless! ....
